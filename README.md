- generate  common ui-components, each with a chakra component (we'll generate another one as part of the demo)
- generate 2 other libs: admin-area, client-store
- generate 2 components in each lib
- generate a feature in each lib

- generate a 3rd component in "common"
- generate a common storybook lib that pulls in all
- add tags to the projects
  - see how I can explain it - maybe have one of the ui-libs import the feature?
  - maybe have someone in common import from a team?


Optional:
- test out nx console - can I do an of the above in it?


- recreate the above, memorise all the commands, but in old version of Nx - and then try the migrate commands 


commands:
npx create-nx-workspace --preset=react
