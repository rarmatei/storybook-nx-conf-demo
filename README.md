next steps:
- generate 2 scopes for admin and pizza order
- generate a random UI component, and a feature lib in pizza order
- generate 2 features in admin
- generate a "data access" lib in common
- fix storybooks so they have good inputs/output
- create shared storybook project
  
Optional:
- test out nx console - can I do an of the above in it?
  - maybe once I use the command to generate a lib, I can use the console and right click on the project to generate a storybook config
- recreate the above, memorise all the commands, but in old version of Nx - and then try the migrate commands 
- add tags to the projects
  - see how I can explain it - maybe have one of the ui-libs import the feature?
  - maybe have someone in common import from a team?
