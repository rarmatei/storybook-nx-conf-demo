next steps:
- fix storybooks so they have good inputs/output
- create shared storybook project 
- create a workspace schematic
- recreate the above, memorise all the commands, but in old version of Nx - and then try the migrate commands


Optional:
- test out nx console - can I do an of the above in it?
  - maybe once I use the command to generate a lib, I can use the console and right click on the project to generate a storybook config
- add tags to the projects
- I'll need to try out extracting the button, and seeing how a test for it would look like
